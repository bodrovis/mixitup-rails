# Reporting issues

Please remember that this gem is merely **a wrapper** for the [MixItUp library](https://github.com/patrickkunka/mixitup). This means that all issues
related to MixItUp itself **should not be reported** here (there is a [separate issue tracker](https://github.com/patrickkunka/mixitup/issues) for that).

If you wish to report a **problem related to this gem**, please provide:

* Syptoms of the problem
* Your Ruby/Rails version
* Version of the gem you are using
* Error stack trace
* Any errors/warnings displayed in the browser's console
* The code you are using to integrate and initialize the library

Thank you for understanding! Hopefully, this gem will make your life as a developer a bit easier :).
